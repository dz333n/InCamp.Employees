# InCamp.Employees

This repository contains:

 - A library to manage sheets (SheetLib);
 - A program to convert inCamp CSV table to a required form (InCamp.Employees).
 
# SheetLib

SheetLib is a very light and simple table managament library! Currently it *almost* supports CSV tables (still contains unimplemented features and may contain bugs!). It can be extended to support more table formats.
